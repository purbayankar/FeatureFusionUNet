# FeatureFusionUNet
This repository contains various UNet models for satellite images change detection using OSCD dataset.
[FeatureFusionUNet](https://github.com/purbayankar/FeatureFusionUNet/blob/main/Proposed_FeatureFusionUNet.ipynb) and 
[DeconvUNet](https://github.com/purbayankar/FeatureFusionUNet/blob/main/DeconvUNet.ipynb) are the two models  proposed by me. <br/>

In <b>DeconvUnet<b/> Network Deconvolution is used. <br/>
